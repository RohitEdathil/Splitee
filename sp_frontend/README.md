# Splitee

The app for splitting bills with friends.

## Why Flutter?

- Its awesome
- I am most comfortable with it for making frontend apps
- Can get things done quickly
- Beautiful UIs can be made easily
- Good for web-oriented apps

## Installation

The app can be installed from the releases page.

## Building

- Clone the repo
- Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
- Run `flutter run` to run the app

## Structuring

I prefer a **feature-first** approach to structuring the code. This means that all the code related to a particular feature is grouped together in a folder. This makes it easier to find code related to a particular feature and makes it easier to maintain.

- **auth:** Authentication related code
- **bill:** Code for bill related stuff
- **components:** Reusable components to be used across the app
- **group:** Code for group related stuff
- **home:** Code for home screen
- **theme:** Contains stuff that determine the look and feel of the app
- **user:** Code for user related stuff
- **api:** API client lives here
